- **Coefficient:** [Paste the number from your terminal output here]
- **Formula Used:** $$r = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$$



## Task 2: Spam Detection
1. **Data Link:** [Provide link to emails.csv in your repo]
2. **Model:** Logistic Regression trained on 70% of the data. 
3. **Accuracy:** [Paste accuracy score]
4. **Confusion Matrix:** [Paste Matrix]

### Composed Emails
- **Spam:** "WINNER! You have won a 1000 dollar..." 
- **Explanation:** I used typical spam keywords like "Winner", "Prize", and "Click here" which high coefficients in the model typically associate with spam.
